# Sample Azure DevOps pipeline
# Showcasing integration of twistcli scanning

# This sample relies on environment variables for connectivity to Twistlock

# TL_USER:  The Twistlock user with the CI User role
# TL_PASS:  The password for this user account
# TL_CONSOLE_URL:  The base URL for the console -- http://console.<my_company>.com:8083 -- without a trailing /

# First, build our image
# Use a Linux-based agent such as Ubuntu 16.04

resources:
- repo: self
queue:
  name: Hosted Ubuntu 1604
steps:
- task: Docker@0
  displayName: 'Build an image'
  inputs:
    containerregistrytype: 'Container Registry'

    dockerRegistryConnection: dockerhub

# Use a script step to pull twistcli and scan the image that was built

- script: |
   
   # Using our credentials, download twistcli from Console and make it executable
   curl -k -u $TL_USER:$TL_PASS --output ./twistcli $TL_CONSOLE_URL/api/v1/util/twistcli
   sudo chmod a+x ./twistcli
   
   # Run the scan with twistcli, providing detailed results in Azure DevOps and
   # pushing the results to the Twistlock console.
   # --details returns all vulnerabilities & compliance issues rather than just summaries.
   # -address points to our Twistlock console
   # -u and -p provide credentials for the console.  These creds only need the CI User role.
   # Finally, we provide the name of the image we built with 'docker build', above.
   ./twistcli images scan --details -address $TL_CONSOLE_URL -u $TL_USER -p $TL_PASS $(Build.Repository.Name):$(Build.BuildId)
   
   # Add --vulnerability-threshold and/or --compliance-threshold to this command to
   # fail builds based on the thresholds.
   # See twistcli documentation for more details.
